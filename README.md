# all-npm-package-names

Easily download all npm's package names.

## Why?

There are many other packages and programs that do the same thing this one does, except they've been updated many years ago or require you to go through an interface (e.g. JavaScript) to access the packages. This is just a plaintext list that you can use any program with.

## How often is it updated?

It is updated every hour, but the update may or may not succeed depending on if npm is up. This is because GitHub's runners aren't guaranteed to start precisely at that time, and the npm server's bandwidth fluctuates a lot.

As long as GitHub Actions is running, this repo should be alive.
