# all-npm-package-names

Easily download all npm's package names.

## Why?

There are many other packages and programs that do the same thing this one does, except they've been updated many years ago or require you to go through an interface (e.g. JavaScript) to access the packages. This is just a plaintext list that you can use any program with.

## How often is it updated?

It (will) start the update every day at 00:00 UTC, but the new packages' could be available many hours later. This is because GitHub's runners aren't guaranteed to start precisely at that time, and the npm server's bandwidth fluctuates a lot.

As long as GitHub Actions is running, this repo should be alive.
